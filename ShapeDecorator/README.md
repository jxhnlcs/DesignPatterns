# ShapeDecorator
A program using the Decorator Design Pattern
# Exercise
- You get two types, Circle and Square, and a decorator named ColoredShape.
- The decorator adds the color to the string output for a certain shape, just like we did in the classic decorator. 
- There's a trick: the decorator now has a resize() method that should resize the underlying shape.
- However, only Circle has a resize() method; the Square no - don't add it!

- You are prompted to complete the implementation of ColoredShape.

The result should be:

`A circle of radius 5 has the color red `

`A circle of radius 10 has the color red`
  
`A square with side 2 has the color blue`
  
` A square with side 2 has the color blue `
